### **Essential Knowledge:**  Precedents and stare decisis
- Precedents and stare decisis

#### **Making Connections:**

1. **Landmark Supreme Court Cases:**
   - *Example 1:* **Brown v. Board of Education (1954):** This landmark case overturned the precedent set by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the "separate but equal" doctrine. Brown v. Board of Education ruled that state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students were unconstitutional. The decision marked a shift in judicial precedent and contributed to the dismantling of segregation laws.

   - *Example 2:* **Roe v. Wade (1973):** In this case, the Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose to have an abortion. The decision built upon the precedent set in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which established a right to privacy in marital relations. The stare decisis principle, in this context, supported the extension of privacy rights to a woman's decision regarding abortion.


### **Essential Knowledge:**  Ideological changes in the composition of the Supreme Court
- Ideological changes in the composition of the Supreme Court resulting from presidential appointments 

#### **Making Connections:**

1. **Shifts in Judicial Philosophy:**
   - *Example 1:* **The Warren Court (1953-1969):** Chief Justice Earl Warren's appointment by President Eisenhower led to a Court known for its liberal decisions. The Warren Court established groundbreaking precedents in areas such as civil rights (Brown v. Board of Education) and criminal justice (Miranda v. Arizona). These decisions reflected a shift in the Court's philosophy toward protecting individual rights and promoting social justice.

   - *Example 2:* **The Rehnquist and Roberts Courts (1986-present):** The appointments made by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush contributed to the evolution of a more conservative Supreme Court. The Rehnquist and Roberts Courts have seen decisions that reflect a conservative judicial philosophy, including limits on affirmative action (Grutter v. Bollinger) and the recognition of an individual right to bear arms (District of Columbia v. Heller).

### **Essential Knowledge:**  Controversial or unpopular Supreme Court decisions 
Controversial or unpopular Supreme Court decisions have the potential to raise challenges to the Court's legitimacy and power. 
#### **Making Connections:**

1. **Presidential Appointments:**
   - *Example 1:* **FDR's Court-Packing Plan (1937):** In response to a series of decisions striking down New Deal legislation, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed expanding the number of Supreme Court justices. While not implemented, the plan was designed to allow Roosevelt to appoint additional justices sympathetic to his policies, thereby altering the Court's ideological balance and potentially influencing future decisions.

   - *Example 2:* **Recent Supreme Court Vacancies:** Presidents have the power to shape the Court's direction through appointments. The nomination and confirmation of justices aligning with a particular political ideology can, over time, shift the Court's stance on key issues. The controversy surrounding the confirmation hearings underscores the significance of these appointments and their potential impact on the Court's decisions.

2. **Legislative Response:**
   - *Example 1:* **Congressional Legislation in Response to Decisions:** When the Court issues decisions that generate public or legislative backlash, Congress may attempt to address concerns through legislation. For example, Congress responded to the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (2007) by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (2009), amending employment discrimination laws.

   - *Example 2:* **Voting Rights Act of 1965:** In response to the Court's decisions, such as South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966), which upheld the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act, Congress has at times amended or extended legislation to address ongoing issues related to voting rights and racial discrimination. Legislative responses can reflect a desire to counteract or reinforce the Court's rulings.

3. **Enforcement and Implementation:**
   - *Example 1:* **Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857):** The Dred Scott decision, which denied citizenship to African Americans and declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional, was controversial and contributed to the sectional tensions leading to the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln and Congress rejected the decision's authority, refusing to implement its implications, and eventually, constitutional amendments nullified its impact.

   - *Example 2:* **Obergefell v. Hodges (2015):** The Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide prompted debates about religious freedom and LGBTQ+ rights. Some state officials resisted implementing the decision, leading to legal battles over the enforcement of marriage equality.

### **Essential Knowledge:**  Judicial Activism v. Judicial Restraint
The ongoing debate over "Judicial Activism" versus "Judicial Restraint" reflects differing views on the appropriate role of the judiciary in interpreting and shaping public policy. These terms describe contrasting approaches to judicial decision-making and the extent to which judges should actively intervene in political and social issues.

#### **Making Connections:**

1. **Judicial Activism:**
   - *Definition:* **Judicial Activism** refers to an approach where judges interpret the Constitution and laws in a way that actively advances or promotes certain social, economic, or political goals. It often involves a willingness to expand constitutional rights or address perceived injustices, even if it requires reinterpreting precedent or existing legal doctrines.

   - *Example 1:* **Brown v. Board of Education (1954):** The Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education is often cited as an example of judicial activism. The Court overturned the precedent set by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. This decision was a significant intervention in addressing racial segregation.

   - *Example 2:* **Obergefell v. Hodges (2015):** The decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide is considered an instance of judicial activism. The Court, in this case, extended constitutional protections to same-sex couples, establishing a new precedent that had a profound impact on social and legal norms.

2. **Judicial Restraint:**
   - *Definition:* **Judicial Restraint** is an approach where judges limit their own power, deferring to the elected branches of government and adhering closely to the text and original intent of the Constitution and statutes. Those advocating for judicial restraint argue that judges should avoid making policy decisions and defer to the democratic process unless there is a clear constitutional violation.

   - *Example 1:* **United States v. Lopez (1995):** In this case, the Supreme Court exercised judicial restraint by striking down a federal law banning guns near schools. The Court held that the law exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause, emphasizing the need for clear constitutional authority to regulate certain activities.

   - *Example 2:* **Gonzales v. Raich (2005):** Contrasting with the Lopez decision, the Court exhibited judicial restraint in Gonzales v. Raich by upholding federal regulations on marijuana use, even when it involved intrastate, non-commercial activity. The decision acknowledged Congress's broad authority to regulate activities that could impact interstate commerce.

3. **Contemporary Debate:**
   - *Example:* **Affordable Care Act (2012):** The Supreme Court's decision upholding the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius illustrates the ongoing debate between judicial activism and restraint. Justices held differing views on the extent of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause, showcasing the contemporary divide over the appropriate role of the judiciary in addressing complex policy issues.

### **Essential Knowledge:**  Checks and Balances on SC
Checks on the Supreme Court are represented by various mechanisms that serve to balance the power of the judiciary within the U.S. government system.

#### **Making Connections:**

1. **Congressional Legislation to Modify the Impact of Prior Supreme Court Decisions:**
   - *Example 1:* **Civil Rights Act of 1964:** In response to Supreme Court decisions like Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and subsequent civil rights rulings, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This legislation aimed to enforce the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause and counteract racial segregation. It exemplifies Congress's use of legislation to shape the legal landscape in response to Supreme Court decisions.

   - *Example 2:* **Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (2009):** In reaction to the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (2007), which limited the timeframe for filing pay discrimination claims, Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This legislative response modified the impact of the Court's decision, emphasizing the role of legislation in shaping legal outcomes.

2. **Constitutional Amendments:**
   - *Example 1:* **19th Amendment (1920):** The 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote, serves as an example of a constitutional amendment responding to Supreme Court decisions. While not a direct response to a specific case, it reflects a broader societal and legislative check on the Court's interpretation of constitutional rights.

   - *Example 2:* **26th Amendment (1971):** The 26th Amendment, lowering the voting age to 18, was in part a response to the Supreme Court's decision in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970). The amendment clarified the constitutional authority to set voting age requirements, demonstrating the use of constitutional amendments to influence the Court's interpretations.

3. **Judicial Appointments and Confirmations:**
   - *Example 1:* **Appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch (2017):** Justice Gorsuch's appointment by President Trump and subsequent confirmation by the Senate shifted the balance of the Court. This appointment illustrates the executive and legislative branches' ability to influence the Court's composition and potentially impact its future decisions.

   - *Example 2:* **Nomination of Judge Merrick Garland (2016):** The Senate's refusal to hold hearings for Judge Garland, nominated by President Obama, exemplifies how the confirmation process can be used as a check. The decision to withhold confirmation hearings influenced the Court's composition.

4. **President and States Evading or Ignoring Supreme Court's Decisions:**
   - *Example 1:* **Andrew Jackson's Response to Worcester v. Georgia (1832):** President Andrew Jackson famously disregarded the Supreme Court's decision in Worcester v. Georgia, which affirmed Native American rights against state interference. Jackson's refusal to enforce the decision reflected a historical instance of executive resistance to the Court's authority.

   - *Example 2:* **Resistance to Brown v. Board of Education (1954) in Southern States:** Some Southern states resisted and delayed the implementation of the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, highlighting instances where states evaded or ignored the Court's rulings on desegregation.

5. **Legislation Impacting Court Jurisdictions:**
   - *Example 1:* **Jurisdictional Limits in the Alien and Sedition Acts (1798):** The Alien and Sedition Acts expanded the jurisdiction of federal courts, allowing for the prosecution of individuals critical of the government. This legislative expansion of judicial authority exemplifies how Congress can impact court jurisdictions to align with specific political objectives.

   - *Example 2:* **Antitrust Legislation and the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890):** The Sherman Antitrust Act expanded the federal courts' jurisdiction over antitrust cases, reflecting Congress's response to economic concerns and its role in defining the legal parameters within which the Supreme Court operates.


## Key Questions: 

### **Judicial Review and its Check on Other Branches and State Governments:**
Judicial review is the power of the judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, to review and potentially invalidate government actions that are deemed unconstitutional. This principle allows the Court to check the power of the other branches (executive and legislative) and state governments by assessing the constitutionality of their laws and actions. Through landmark cases such as Marbury v. Madison (1803), the Supreme Court established the authority to interpret the Constitution and declare laws or executive actions unconstitutional, serving as a crucial mechanism for maintaining a system of checks and balances.

### **Judicial Review, Life Tenure, and Debate about Legitimacy:**
The exercise of judicial review, coupled with the life tenure of Supreme Court justices, can lead to debates about the legitimacy of the Court's power. Critics argue that unelected justices, insulated from direct public accountability, may wield significant influence over policy and social issues for decades. This debate underscores the tension between an independent judiciary and democratic governance, as justices appointed for life can shape the legal landscape long after the political context in which they were appointed.

### **Limiting Supreme Court's Power by Other Branches:**
Other branches of the government can limit the Supreme Court's power through various means. The President, who appoints justices, can influence the Court's direction by selecting nominees aligned with their ideology. Additionally, the executive branch may choose not to fully enforce certain Court decisions, impacting their practical effect. Congress holds the authority to alter the Court's jurisdiction, regulate its appellate jurisdiction, and, in extreme cases, initiate constitutional amendments to counter specific decisions. These mechanisms reflect the constitutional design aimed at preventing any single branch from becoming overly dominant in the federal system.
