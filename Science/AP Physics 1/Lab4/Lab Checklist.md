Data Table
- [x] 5 rows of data for each part (Subtract 1 point for each missing) 

Graph of Acceleration vs. Net Force for Part 1
- [x] Scale on both axes.
- [x] 5 points plotted from data table.
- [x] Best-fit straight (not-freehanded) line
- [x] Regression equation with slope [You would need a calculator for this - Zhe] 

Graph of Acceleration vs. Mass for Part 2
- [x] Scale on both axes.
- [x] 5 points plotted from data table.

Error Analysis
